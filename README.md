# Graphics-Renderer
Basic Direct3D rendering program. This software can load and render 3d objects stored in text files and apply textures to them. The objects can be moved around and rotated. The sole purpose of this project was to learn how Direct3D works and how to implement it.

This program uses the DirectX 11 SDK version but uses the DirectX 10 feature set.

The DirectX SDK is needed to compile this project.

I am aware that the code is not the most elegant and that it has several bugs but it served its purpose as a learning project.
